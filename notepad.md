#### Some realization of mine.
I should revisit and restructure my codes again and again,
it is a very very wonderful practice,
teaches a lot of things.
Because, when revisiting again,
It revises the past practices,
restrutring makes it more beautiful,
better enhance the program further,
en every aspect.

I should be able to fully cloud my projects,
that they should be constant sync online-offline,
in this way, I would be able to even delete files from computer,
then again will be able to sync it back again,
restructre and put it back up online,
backup thing is good it is.
And increases the portability also.

Revisiting past projects is good,
teaches a lot of things again and again.

Documentation should be up_to_mark.

These are some of the things, from wisdom I infer that should be inculcated in my habits.
