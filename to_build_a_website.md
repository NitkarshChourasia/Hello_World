Using SQL in Your Web Site

To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

    An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
    To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
    To use SQL to get the data you want
    To use HTML / CSS to style the page
