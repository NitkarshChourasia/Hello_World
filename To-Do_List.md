# To-do list. 
---
1. Text Adventure - Is a story based puzzle.

Here, the imagination is the limit for this story.

2. Messanging apps with CLI integrated.

Like, Whatsapp - Telegram,etc...,

3. Should make a story-based interactive counselling app and should upload it to playstore,
that way I would be able to write a blog and code as well at the same time, 
and people would love it very much.
Because blog reading and all these things are of the past, right?
Means they are engaging, but not interactive,
what If I make it interactive or so?
I will be like a interactive blogging app, right?
A new kind of revolution, hehe.
Just to help people that's it.

4. Create a mind map of languages(obviously common ones).
  (i.) Write down their applications.
 (ii.) With the framework being used.
(iii.) Creator who made it.
(iv.)  Where it is used most extensively.
